### 28 October 2017: **Puzzling Pentagrams**

1. Moving Checkers

Place six checkers on a table in a row, alternating them black, white,
black, white, block white.  Move the checkers so that all the white
one will end on the left, followed by the black ones. The checkers
must be moved in pairs, taking two adjacent at a time, without
disturbing the order, and sliding them to a vacant place. Only three
such moves are necessary.  (From "The Moscow Puzzles", by Boris A
Kordemsky)

This was a pretty successful problem. The girls enjoyed moving the
stones around and find a solution.

2. Count!

How many different triangles are there in the pentagram figure?

(From "The Moscow Puzzles", by Boris A Kordemsky)

We were able to identify all the types of triangles, but we didn't
find a successful strategy for counting all 35 triangles, despite
several persistent efforts from the girls.

### 21 October 2017: **Scrambled Box Tops**

Some more variations on the puzzle from 13 October.

### 13 October 2017: **Stick Puzzles**

1. Use 12 sticks to form polygons with integral areas. The entire
length of the stick must be used with no overlapping, but more than
one stick may be used for an edge. Assuming the sticks have unit
length, what how many area units does your polygon have?

The solutions we had were: square with area 9 and rectangle with area
8.  The challenge to get back to later: form a polygon of exactly four
square units.  (From _My Best Mathematical and Logic Puzzels_ by
Martin Gardner, Puzzle 14, "The 12 Matches".)

2. Scrambled Box Tops 

Imagine that you have three boxes, one containing two black marbles,
one containing two white marbles, and the third, one black marble and
one white marble. The boxes were labeled for their contents but
someone has switched the labels so that every box in now incorrectly
labeled. You are allowed to take one marble at a time out of any box,
without looking inside, and by this process of sampling you are to
determine the contents of all three boxes. What is the smallest number
of drawing needed to do this?  (From _My Best Mathematical and Logic
Puzzels_ by Martin Gardner, Puzzle 5, "Scrambled Box Tops".)

This was a nice challenge, not too hard and kept all of us
engaged. The temptation to pick in the box or get both marbles out was
a bit too much. It worked best when three people were hiding the
marbles one in each hand.

### 23 September 2017: **Weight Puzzle**

There are twelve balls, eleven are the same, but one has a different
weight from the others. How can you find the ball with the different
weight using the minimum number of scale weighings?

The farmer has a fox (who will eat the goose), goose (who will eat the
grain), and grain to bring back from the market in a boat that can
only carry one at a time. How can the farmer get everyone safely to
shore?

### 26 August 2017: **Eclipse**

On August 21 there was a total solar eclipse for parts of the US, and a near-total solar eclipse for Charlottesville. For the next math club, we wanted to understand what an Eclipse was, and why they are so rare. 

<center>

The big purple ball represents the sun. 

<center>
<table>
<tr>
<td width="20%"><b>Radius of Sun</b></td><td width="15%"> 432288 miles</td>
<td width="33%"><b>Distance from Sun to Earth</b></td><td width="32%"> 93 million miles = 215 sun radii</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><b>Radius of the Earth</b></td><td> 3959 miles</td>
<td><b>Earth radii to Sun</b></td><td> 23,480</td></tr>
<tr>
<td><b>Radius of the Moon</b></td><td> 1079 miles</td>
<td><b>Distance from Earth to Moon</b></td><td> 239,800 miles = 60.5 earth radii</td></tr>
</tr>
</table>
</center>

So, to represent the Earth we need something roughly 1/109 the radius
of the sun. For the big purple ball, which has radius about 10 inches,
we needed something with radius 0.01 inches - a small marble was the
closest readily available, but with its blue and green swirly color
made an excellent earth. The moon, 1/3 the radius of the earth, was a
small piece of fuzz.

Scaling the size of the Sun down to the big purple ball, means the
distance to the earth (normally 93 million miles) would scale down as
1 inch = 43228 miles. This mean the earth should be 179 feet away from
the sun, and the moon would be 5.5 inches from the earth.

</td>
</tr>
</table>
</center>

It actually worked! If you held the moon (fuzz) in just the right
place, it would just occlude the sun.

### 23 February 2017: **Crazy Calendars**

Calendars are puzzles - the last day of this month, first with the
first day of the next month.  There are different shapes of months
because the number of days is either 30 or 31, and February is really
odd.
