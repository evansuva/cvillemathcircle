#### What's a "Math Circle"?

A _math circle_ is a group of people playing together with mathematical
puzzles and problems.  Our math circle is for three and four year-old
girls, and focused on open exploration with mathematical concepts.

### Meetings 

Saturdays at 3:30pm (starting 27 February 2016), [Fontana Clubhouse](https://bit.ly/1RTNLkK).

Mixing water colors is _commutative_!  This means we end up with the
same color when we mix the same colors, regardless of the order in which
they are mixed.  Mostly, though, we eventually end up with a murky, greenish-purple
color after enough colors are combined.
