### May 18: **Sharing Marbles**

_(From the Math Olympiad Contest Problems, Volume 1)_

A set of marbles can be divided in equal shares among 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6 children with no marbles left over. What is the least number of marbles the set could have?

We also tried the same problem with numbers 3, 5, 7.

Since our crowd does not know multiplication yet, but knows skip count and divisibility criteria, we found two ways to solve the problem. The number we're looking for is the first common one in the number chains of the 4, 5, 6. The other way is to write down the number chain for 7 and use the divisibility criteria for 3 and 5 that we already know to find the number.

### 4 May 2018: **Divisibility**

We can tell if a number is divisible by 3 by summing its digits and seeing if the result is divisible by 3!

</center>
-->

The works because 10 = (3 * 3) + 1. So, each multiple of 10 that is added, is adding 1 modulo 3.

### 28 April 2018: **Puzzling Pennies**

_(From the Math Olympiad Contest Problems, Volume 1)_ From a pile of 100 pennies, 100 nickels, and 100 dimes, select 21 coins that have a total value of exactly $1.00. In your selection you must also use at least one coin of each type. How many couns of each of the three types should be selected?

### 21 April 2018: **Coin Puzzle**

_(From the Math Olympiad Contest Problems, Volume 1)_ I have 30 coins consisting of nickels and quarters. The total value of the coins is $4.10. How many of each kind do I have?

The tower below is made up of five horizontal layers of cubes with no gaps. How many individual cubes are in the tower?

### 1 December 2017: **Out with the Onion**

From Martin Gardner's _My Best Mathematical and Logic Puzzles_ (55): Move
two matches, to remake a class, but with the cherry outside.

**Dissection Dilemma** (57): divide a square into _five_ parts, all
  identical in size and shape.


### 24 November 2017: **Apples and Sticks**

1. Given three piles of 11, 7, and 6 stones, respectively. You can
only move from one pile to another exactly as many stones are at the
destination. In three moves, obtain three piles of 8 stones. (From
_The Moscow Puzzles_, by Boris A Kordemsky)

    First Dorina and Anya had a solution in four moves that starts with
moving from the 11 stone pile to the 6 stone pile: (11,7,6),
(5,7,12),(10,2,12),(8,4,12),(8,8,8). After a few tries, they figured
out the three moves solution: (11,7,6), (4,14,6), (4,8,12), (8,8,8).

2. Five apples are in a basket. How do you divide them among five
girls so that each girl gets and apple, but one apple remains in the
basket. (From _The Moscow Puzzles_, by Boris A Kordemsky) This was
quite confusing, until David brought a prop. Then it seemed silly.

3. Take 4 sticks of equal length and 4 more of equal length twice the
first length. Use all 8 to make 3 squares of equal size. Itâ€™s
acceptable to cross two long sticks.  This was a pretty hard one. It
took a while, but we finally did it.

</center>

If two numbers, <em>n</em> and <em>k</em> are relatively prime, we
will touch every number in the modulo number ring for <em>n</em> going
by multiples of <em>k</em>. Dorina picked 25 and 6, Anya picked 12 and
5, Charlotte picked 12 and 3 (not relatively prime, so doesn't touch
every number), and Madelyn picked a number too big to finish.

### 28 October 2017: **Puzzling Pentagrams**

#### Moving Checkers

Place six checkers on a table in a row, alternating them black, white,
black, white, block white.  Move the checkers so that all the white
one will end on the left, followed by the black ones. The checkers
must be moved in pairs, taking two adjacent at a time, without
disturbing the order, and sliding them to a vacant place. Only three
such moves are necessary.  (From _The Moscow Puzzles_, by Boris A
Kordemsky)

This was a pretty successful problem. The girls enjoyed moving the
stones around and find a solution.

<a href="/images/IMG_3614.jpg"><img src="/images/IMG_3614-2.jpg" width=650></a>
</center>

#### Count!

How many different triangles are there in the pentagram figure? (From _The Moscow Puzzles_, by Boris A Kordemsky)

We were able to identify all the types of triangles, but we didn't find a successful strategy for counting all 35 triangles, despite several persistent efforts from the girls.

### 21 October 2017: **Scrambled Box Tops**

Some more variations on the puzzle from 13 October.

### 13 October 2017: **Stick Puzzles**

1. Use 12 sticks to form polygons with integral areas. The entire
length of the stick must be used with no overlapping, but more than
one stick may be used for an edge. Assuming the sticks have unit
length, what how many area units does your polygon have?

    The solutions we had were: square with area 9 and rectangle with area 8. The challenge to get back to later: form a polygon of exactly four
square units.  (From _My Best Mathematical and Logic Puzzels_ by
Martin Gardner, Puzzle 14, "The 12 Matches".)

2. Scrambled Box Tops 

    Imagine that you have three boxes, one containing two black marbles,
one containing two white marbles, and the third, one black marble and
one white marble. The boxes were labeled for their contents but
someone has switched the labels so that every box in now incorrectly
labeled. You are allowed to take one marble at a time out of any box,
without looking inside, and by this process of sampling you are to
determine the contents of all three boxes. What is the smallest number
of drawing needed to do this?  (From _My Best Mathematical and Logic
Puzzels_ by Martin Gardner, Puzzle 5, "Scrambled Box Tops".)

    This was a nice challenge, not too hard and kept all of us
engaged. The temptation to pick in the box or get both marbles out was
a bit too much. It worked best when three people were hiding the
marbles one in each hand.

### 26 August 2017: **Eclipse**

On August 21 there was a total solar eclipse for parts of the US, and a near-total solar eclipse for Charlottesville. For the next math club, we wanted to understand what an Eclipse was, and why they are so rare. 

<center>
<a href="/images/IMG_3306.jpg"><img src="/images/IMG_3306-2.jpg" width="650"></img></a>
</center>

The big purple ball represents the sun. 

<center>
<table>
<tr>
<td width="20%"><b>Radius of Sun</b></td><td width="15%"> 432288 miles</td>
<td width="33%"><b>Distance from Sun to Earth</b></td><td width="32%"> 93 million miles = 215 sun radii</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><b>Radius of the Earth</b></td><td> 3959 miles</td>
<td><b>Earth radii to Sun</b></td><td> 23,480</td></tr>
<tr>
<td><b>Radius of the Moon</b></td><td> 1079 miles</td>
<td><b>Distance from Earth to Moon</b></td><td> 239,800 miles = 60.5 earth radii</td></tr>
</tr>
</table>
</center>

So, to represent the Earth we need something roughly 1/109 the radius
of the sun. For the big purple ball, which has radius about 10 inches,
we needed something with radius 0.01 inches - a small marble was the
closest readily available, but with its blue and green swirly color
made an excellent earth. The moon, 1/3 the radius of the earth, was a
small piece of fuzz.

Scaling the size of the Sun down to the big purple ball, means the
distance to the earth (normally 93 million miles) would scale down as
1 inch = 43228 miles. This mean the earth should be 179 feet away from
the sun, and the moon would be 5.5 inches from the earth.

<center>

</td>
</tr>
</table>
</center>

It actually worked! If you held the moon (fuzz) in just the right
place, it would just occlude the sun.

Mixing water colors is _commutative_!  This means we end up with the

they are mixed.  Mostly, though, we eventually end up with a murky, greenish-purple
color after enough colors are combined.
