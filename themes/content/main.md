### Evading Machine Learning-based Malware Classifiers

**EvadeML** is an evolutionary framework based on genetic programming
  for automatically finding variants that evade detection by machine
  learning-based malware classifiers.

Machine learning is widely used to develop classifiers for security
tasks. However, the robustness of these methods against motivated
adversaries is uncertain. In this work, we propose a generic method to
evaluate the robustness of classifiers under attack. The key idea is to
stochastically manipulate a malicious sample to find a variant that
preserves the malicious behavior but is classified as benign by the
classifier. We present a general approach to search for evasive variants
and report on results from experiments using our techniques against two
PDF malware classifiers, PDFrate and Hidost. Our method is able to
automatically find evasive variants for both classifiers for all of the
500 malicious seeds in our study. Our results suggest a general method
for evaluating classifiers used in security applications, and raise
serious doubts about the effectiveness of classifiers based on
superficial features in the presence of adversaries.
